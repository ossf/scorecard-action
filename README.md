# Scorecards' GitHub action
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ossf/scorecard-action/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=MAXISWR53I)](https://codecov.io/gh/ossf/scorecard-action)
> Official GitHub Action for [OSSF Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard).

The Scorecards GitHub Action is free for all public repositories. Private repositories are supported if they have [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security). Private repositories without GitHub Advanced Security can run Scorecards from the command line by following the [standard installation instructions](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard#using-scorecards-1).


## Breaking changes in v2

Starting from scorecard-action:v2, `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions or job permissions needs to incude
`id-token: write` for `publish_results: true`. This is needed to access GitHub's
OIDC token which verifies the authenticity of the result when publishing it.

scorecard-action:v2 also requires that the steps in the job running ossf/scorecard-action step
only belong to an approved list of GitHub actions - "actions/checkout", "actions/upload-artifact", "github/codeql-action/upload-sarif".
We understand that this is restrictive but currently this is needed given that GitHub workflow steps belonging to a job
run in the same environment. To ensure the integrity of the results we publish, we are currently making this restriction a requirement
while we work on making this feature more flexible without needing these restrictions.

________

The following GitHub triggers are supported: `push`, `schedule` (default branch only).

The `pull_request` and `workflow_dispatch` triggers are experimental.

Running the Scorecard action on a fork repository is not supported.

Private repositories need a Personal Access Token (PAT).

Public repositories need a PAT to enable the [Branch-Protection](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#branch-protection) check. Without a PAT, Scorecards will run all checks except the Branch-Protection check.

GitHub Enterprise repositories are not supported.

## Installation
The Scorecards Action is installed by setting up a workflow on the GitHub UI.

**Private repositories**: Scorecards requires authentication using a Personal Access Token (PAT). So if you install Scorecards on a private repository, you will need to follow the optional Authentication step. If you don't, Scorecards will fail to run.

**Public repositories**: One Scorecards check ([Branch-Protection](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#branch-protection)) requires authentication using a Personal Access Token (PAT). If you want all Scorecards checks to run on a public repository, you will need to follow the optional Authentication step. If you don't, all checks will run except Branch-Protection.

**Optional Authentication**: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication and save the token value as a repository secret. (Note: If you have already installed Scorecards on your repository from the command line, you can reuse your existing PAT for the repository secret. If you no longer have access to the PAT, though, simply create a new one.)

**Required**: Set up the workflow via the GitHub UI - see [Workflow Setup](#workflow-setup)

### Authentication with PAT
1. [Create a Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo,read:org,read:repo_hook,read:discussion) with the following read permissions:
    - Note: `Read-only token for OSSF Scorecard Action - myorg/myrepo` (Note: replace `myorg/myrepo` with the names of your organization and repository so you can keep track of your tokens.)
    - Expiration: `No expiration`
    - Scopes: 
        * `repo > public_repo`                  Required to read [Branch-Protection](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#branch-protection) settings. **Note**: for private repositories, you need scope `repo`.
        * `admin:org > read:org`                Optional: not used in current implementation.
        * `admin:repo_hook > read:repo_hook`    Optional: needed for the experimental [Webhook](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#webhooks) check.
        * `write:discussion > read:discussion`  Optional: not used in current implementation.

2. Copy the token value. 

3. [Create a new repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) with the following settings:
    - Name: `SCORECARD_READ_TOKEN`
    - Value: the value of the token created in step 1 above.

4. (Optional) If you install Scorecard on a repository owned by an organization that uses [SAML SSO](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on), be sure to [enable SSO](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) for your PAT token.

### Workflow Setup
1) From your GitHub project's main page, click “Security” in the top ribbon. 

![image](/images/install01.png)

2) Click “Set up Code Scanning.” 

![image](/images/install02.png)

Note: if you have already configured other code scanning tools, your UI will look different than shown above. Instead, click "Code Scanning Alerts" on the left side of the page. 

![image](/images/installb1.png)

Then click "Add More Scanning Tools."

![image](/images/installb2.png)

3) Choose the "OSSF Scorecards supply-chain security analysis" from the list of workflows, and then click “set up this workflow.”

## View Results

The workflow is preconfigured to run on every repository contribution. After making a code change, you can view a list of results by going to the Security tab and clicking "Code Scanning Alerts" (it can take a couple minutes for the run to complete and the results to show up). Click on the individual alerts for more information, including remediation instructions. You will need to click "Show more" to expand the full remediation instructions.

### Verify Runs 
The workflow is preconfigured to run on every repository contribution. 

To verify that the Action is running successfully, click the repository's Actions tab to see the status of all recent workflow runs. This tab will also show the logs, which can help you troubleshoot if the run failed.

![image](/images/actionconfirm.png)

### Troubleshooting 
If the run has failed, the most likely reason is an authentication failure. If you are running Scorecards on a private repository, confirm that the Personal Access Token is saved as an encrypted secret within the same repository (see [Authentication](#authentication)). In addition, provide the `repo` scope to your PAT. (The `repo > public_repo` scope only provides access to public repositories).

If you install Scorecards on a repository owned by an organization that uses [SAML SSO](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on) or if you see `403 Resource protected by organization SAML enforcement` in the logs, be sure to [enable SSO](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) for your PAT token (see [Authentication](#authentication)).

If you use a PAT saved as an encrypted secret and the run is still failing, confirm that you have not made any changes to the workflow yaml file that affected the syntax. Review the [workflow example](#workflow-example) and reset to the default values if necessary.

## Manual Action Setup
    
If you prefer to manually set up the Scorecards GitHub Action, you will need to set up a [workflow file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

First, [create a new file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files) in this location: `[yourrepo]/.github/workflows/scorecards-analysis.yml`. Then use the input values below.
 

### Inputs

| Name | Required | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| `result_file` | yes | The file that contains the results. |
| `result_format` | yes | The format in which to store the results [json \| sarif]. For GitHub's scanning dashboard, select `sarif`. |
| `repo_token` | yes | PAT token with read-only access. Follow [these steps](#authentication-with-pat) to create it. |
| `publish_results` | recommended | This will allow you to display a badge on your repository to show off your hard work (release scheduled for Q2'22). See details [here](#publishing-results).|

### Publishing Results
The Scorecard team runs a weekly scan of public GitHub repositories in order to track 
the overall security health of the open source ecosystem. The results of the scans are [publicly
available](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard#public-data).
Setting `publish_results: true` replaces the results of the team's weekly scans with your own scan results, 
helping us scale by cutting down on repeated workflows and GitHub API requests.
This option is also needed to enable badges on the repository (release scheduled for Q2'22). 

### Uploading Artifacts
The Scorecards Action uses the [artifact uploader action](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) to upload results in SARIF format to the Actions tab. These results are available to anybody for five days after the run to help with debugging. To disable the upload, comment out the `Upload Artifact` value in the Workflow Example. 

Note: if you disable this option, the results of the Scorecards Action run will be available only to maintainers (on the Security tab scanning dashboard).
